# Solutions for Introduction to Functional Programming in OCaml

This repo exists to store and document the solutions I develop for the programming class "[Introduction to Functional Programming in OCaml](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:parisdiderot+56002+session03/info)."

The class is offered by [Universit√© Paris Diderot](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/).

**The University has asked that the solutions not be shared online.**
